It's just a basic command and control for now which I created to test in home labs.

--It handles multiple clients 
--it has web based UI

I will be making it more sophisticated stuff over time..here are some things that I'll be adding in future.
1. A customized BOF(Beacon object files)
2. File transfer 
3. Authentications
4. encryption 
5. database logging 
 
That's what I thought of adding up until now..ðŸ«¡
